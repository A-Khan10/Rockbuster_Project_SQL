# Rockbuster_Project_SQL
Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project by CareerFoundry uses PostgreSQL to analyse data from a fictional movie rental company.
# Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.
# Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
# Context
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, I query the data using SQL (short for Structured Query Language). Then translate these answers into Tableau to create [visuals and dashboards.](https://public.tableau.com/views/Rockbustergraphs/Story1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
Finally, create a final presentation for management to view.
